# Random-Walk-Simulation
Consider you are standing at a street corner, in a city where the streets are laid out in a very regular grid pattern. At this point you randomly choose and intersection to turn on to (left, right, forward or backward - letâ€™s say). You walk further to another intersection and make the same random choice. Rinse, lather, repeat. When you finally stop, your winding path is some direct distance away from your starting point. This is an example of a random walk. 

This program simulate 'x' random walks with 'y' steps and return the average distance from the starting point from those walk. x and y are both user inputs.

# Random-Walk-Simulation

Simulation of x walks with y steps by Minh

Description: Consider you are standing at a street corner, in a city where the streets are laid out in a very regular grid pattern. At this point you randomly choose and intersection to turn on to (left, right, forward or backward - letâ€™s say). You walk further to another intersection and make the same random choice. Rinse, lather, repeat. When you finally stop, your winding path is some direct distance away from your starting point. This is an example of a random walk. 

This program simulate 'x' random walks with 'y' steps and **return** the average distance from the starting point from those walk. x and y are both user inputs.

Files included:
  
    Simulation and Design.py:
    - This file contains the simulation and make a visual representation of the code
    - It contains the following key functions:
        + random_walk_2d(w,s): Simulate "w" number of walks with "s" number of steps + Create a Graphing Window
        + random_1_walk(s,win): Simulate 1 random walk with 's' amount of steps on Graphing Window 'win' 

    graphics.py:
    - This file contains all the elements to create the GUI
      
      
State of the project:
- The project runs fie without any known bugs

Here are the demo of the GUI
